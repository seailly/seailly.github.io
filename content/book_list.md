## Fiction

#### [Seveneves](https://www.nealstephenson.com/seveneves.html)
An incredible story about a dystopian event causing humans to escape the earth. The ending chapters are my favourite. Which feel like they could be the base of a video game.

## Non-Fiction

#### [Sandworm](https://andygreenberg.net/books)
The way cyber-warfare is playing out is almost more ridiculous and scary then we had all thought.
