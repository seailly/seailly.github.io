## Fiction

#### [Seveneves](https://www.nealstephenson.com/seveneves.html)
An incredible story about a dystopian event forcing humans to flee off the Earth. The ending few chapters are exceptional. Creating a world which feels like uit could be the base of a new video game.

#### [Ancillary Justice](https://annleckie.com/novel/ancillary-justice/)
This and the remaining trilogy are my favourite sci-fi novels. Written from the view point of an AI with multiple ancillary bodies, it's a really unqiue amongst the kind of books i've read. Also, the audiobook is amazingly narratored by [Adjoa Andoh](https://twitter.com/andoh_adjoa).

## Non-Fiction

#### [Sandworm](https://andygreenberg.net/books)
The way cyber-warfare is playing out is almost more ridiculous and scary then we had all thought.
